## Downloading and installing
* Download XAMPP

Please download and install XAMPP. You can use the following link: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
* Open XAMPP Manager

Once you have completed installation, please open up the Manager Application and navigate to the "Manage Servers" tab.

At the bottom of the "Manage Servers" tab, click the button that says "Start All". After a few short minutes you should see all servers have the status "Running".

NOTE: If your "MySQL Database" server is still NOT running after the previous step, go ahead and highlight the server and then click the "Configure" button on the right hand side. Once in the configure settings, go ahead and change the Port to 3307 instead of 3306 and click "OK". Now try and "Restart All" servers.
